# Task 3

## IDS

Passive monitoring solutions for detecting possible malicious activities/patterns, abnormal activities and policy violations.

There are two  types:

Network Intrusion Detection System(NIDS): monitors the traffic flow from various areas of the network

Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS): monitors the traffic from a single endpoint device.



## IPS

It is responsible for stopping/preventing/terminating suspicious events. It is an active protective solution.

There are <mark style="color:green;">four</mark> main types:

<mark style="color:green;">Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS</mark>) : Aims to protect the entire subnet&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Behaviour-based Intrusion Prevention System (Network Behaviour Analysis - NBA) -:</mark> Similar to the NIPS just they need some training before to differenciate normal traffic and malicious traffic

<mark style="color:green;">Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS)</mark> : Monitors the traffic flow from a wireless network

<mark style="color:green;">Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) :</mark>  Protects the traffic flow from a single endpoint device

<mark style="color:yellow;">Endpoint devices</mark> are phisical devices that are connected on a network and exchange information



## What are the techniques used by these tools?

There are three main:

Signature based: Relies on rules

Behaviour-Based: Checks for normal behaviour and abnormal behaviour

Policy-Based: Detects changes in the system configuration and security policies
