# 🔍 Endpoint Logging and Monitoring

## Windows Event Logs

The Windows Event Logs are not text files that can be viewed using a text editor. However, the raw data can be translated into XML using the Windows API. The events in these log files are stored in a proprietary binary format with a .evt or .evtx extension. The log files with the .evtx file extension typically reside in `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs`.

There are three main ways of accessing these event logs within a Windows system:

1. Event Viewer (GUI-based application)
2. Wevtutil.exe (command-line tool)
3. Get-WinEvent (PowerShell cmdlet
