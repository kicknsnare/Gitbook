Here are some quick observations about this email sample:\


1. This email is made to appear that it's from Netflix Billing, but the sender address is z99@musacombi.online.&#x20;
2. Here is the element of urgency. The account was suspended, so the victim must act quickly.&#x20;
3. There is more of this sense of urgency in the email body.&#x20;

Also, notice the different misspellings of the word Netflix. Not sure what was the purpose of that. \

Ok, here is the meat and potatoes of this email. Apparently, the victim needs to open the attachment (PDF) to update their Netflix account.&#x20;

Notice the phone number for 'Netflix'. At first glance, that is an unusual phone number to send to a US-based victim.&#x20;
