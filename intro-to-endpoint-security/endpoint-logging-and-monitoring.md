# üîç Endpoint Logging and Monitoring

## Windows Event Logs

The Windows Event Logs are not text files that can be viewed using a text editor. However, the raw data can be translated into XML using the Windows API. The events in these log files are stored in a proprietary binary format with a .evt or .evtx extension. The log files with the .evtx file extension typically reside in `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs`.

There are three main ways of accessing these event logs within a Windows system:

1. Event Viewer (GUI-based application)
2. Wevtutil.exe (command-line tool)
3. Get-WinEvent (PowerShell cmdlet



## Sysmon

Sysmon, a tool used to monitor and log events on Windows, is commonly used by enterprises as part of their monitoring and logging solutions. As part of the Windows Sysinternals package, Sysmon is similar to Windows Event Logs with further detail and granular control.



## OSQuery
