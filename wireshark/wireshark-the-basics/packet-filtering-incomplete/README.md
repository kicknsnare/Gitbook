## Conversation Filter

This is a good way to investigate

"right-click menu" or "**Analyse --> Conversation Filter**"



## Coloursise Conversation

right-click menu" or "View --> Colourise Conversation"

This option is similar to the "Conversation Filter" with one difference. It highlights the linked packets without applying a display filter and decreasing the number of viewed packets.
