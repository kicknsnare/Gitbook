# Bonus: Hunt Cleartext Credentials!

Wireshark has such a feature to help analysts who want to hunt cleartext credential entries.

Some Wireshark dissectors (FTP, HTTP, IMAP, pop and SMTP) are programmed to extract cleartext passwords from the capture file. You can view detected credentials using the <mark style="color:yellow;">**`"Tools --> Credentials"`**</mark> menu
