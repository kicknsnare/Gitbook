# Writing Convincing Phising Emails



## The sender's Address

The sender's address would be from a domain name that spoofs a significant brand, a known contact, or a coworker.

```bash
#To find what brands or people a victim interacts with:
Observe Social Media Account the person and his/her friends
Google Dorking 
Business Website for suppliers
Linkedin profile
```

## The subject

My note: Since people is getting aware of phishing emails and scams you might investigate what would the person click. What kind of interactions does the person make in a daily basis.

## The content

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash">Search for the email template of the legitimate brand and make the 
content look the same
<strong>#If impersonating a person 
</strong><strong>It could be beneficial to contact the person first and imitate her/his behavior
</strong><strong>
</strong></code></pre>

If you've set up a spoof website to harvest data or distribute malware, the links to this should be disguised using the [anchor text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor\_text) and changing it either to some text which says "Click Here" or changing it to a correct looking link that reflects the business you are spoofing, for example:

`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">Click Here</a>`

`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">https://onlinebank.thm</a>`
