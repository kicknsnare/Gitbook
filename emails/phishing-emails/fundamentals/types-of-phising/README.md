# Types of Phising



## BEC

Business Email Compromise

A BEC is when an adversary gains control of an internal employee's account and then uses the compromised email account to convince other internal employees to perform unauthorized or fraudulent actions.&#x20;



* [Spam](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam) - unsolicited junk emails
* [Phishing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/phishing) -  emails sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information.&#x20;
* [Spear phishing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spear-phishing) - takes phishing a step further by targeting a specific individual(s) or organization seeking sensitive information. &#x20;
* [Whaling](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/whaling-phishing-attacks/) - is similar to spear phishing, but it's targeted specifically to C-Level high-position individuals (CEO, CFO, etc.), and the objective is the same.&#x20;
* [Smishing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/smishing) - mobile messages
* [Vishing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/vishing) - voice calls

Below are typical characteristics phishing emails have in common:

* The sender email name/address will masquerade as a trusted entity ([email spoofing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/email-spoofing))
* The email subject line and/or body (text) is written with a sense of urgency or uses certain keywords such as Invoice, Suspended, etc.&#x20;
* The email body (HTML) is designed to match a trusting entity (such as Amazon)
* The email body (HTML) is poorly formatted or written (contrary from the previous point)
* The email body uses generic content, such as Dear Sir/Madam.&#x20;
* Hyperlinks (oftentimes uses URL shortening services to hide its true origin)
* A [malicious attachment](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malicious-email-attachments) posing as a legitimate document
