Here are some quick observations about this email sample:

1. This email is made to appear that it's from Apple Support, but the sender's address is gibberish@sumpremed.com.&#x20;
2. This email wasn't sent directly to the victim's inbox but rather BCCed ([Blind Carbon Copy](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/help-desk/how-to-documents/using-blind-carbon-copy-bcc-feature-protect-privacy-email-addresses)). The recipient email looks like another spoofed email to appear as a legitimate Apple email address.&#x20;
3. Here is the element of urgency. Action is required on behalf of the victim.&#x20;
