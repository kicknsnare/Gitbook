Some important points to understand about the sidebar are explained below:

| 1- Selected Fields          | Splunk extracts the default fields like source, sourcetype, and host, which appear in each event, and places them under the selected fields column. We can select other fields that seem essential and add them to the list. |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2- Interesting Fields       | Pulls all the interesting fields it finds and displays them in the left panel to further explore.                                                                                                                            |
| 3- Alpha-numeric fields 'Î±' | This alpha symbol shows that the field contains text values.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4- Numeric fields '#'       | This symbol shows that this field contains numerical values.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5- Count                    | The number against each field shows the number of events captured in that timeframe.                                                                                                                                         |
