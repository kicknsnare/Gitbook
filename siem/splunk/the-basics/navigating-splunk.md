Let's look at each section, or panel, that makes up the home screen. The top panel is the Splunk Bar (below image).&#x20;

In the Splunk Bar, you can see system-level messages (Messages), configure the Splunk instance (Settings), review the progress of jobs (Activity), miscellaneous information such as tutorials (Help), and a search feature (Find).&#x20;

The ability to switch between installed Splunk apps instead of using the Apps panel can be achieved from the Splunk Bar, like in the image below.

The default app for every Splunk installation is Search & Reporting.&#x20;

Splunk Dashboard

The last section is the Home Dashboard. By default, no dashboards are displayed. You can choose from a range of dashboards readily available within your Splunk instance. You can select a dashboard from the dropdown menu or by visiting the dashboards listing page.

You can also create dashboards and add them to the Home Dashboard. The dashboards you create can be viewed isolated from the other dashboards by clicking on the Yours tab.
