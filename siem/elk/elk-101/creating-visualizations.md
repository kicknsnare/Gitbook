# Creating Visualizations



## Before

Before creating any visualizations please check the post-creation steps down below

## Create Visualization

Correlation Option\


Often, we require creating correlations between multiple fields. Dragging the required field in the middle will create a correlation tab in the visualization tab. Here we selected the Source\_Country as the second field to show a correlation among the client Source\_IP.

We can also create a table to show the values of the selected fields as columns, as shown below.

The most important step in creating these visualizations is to save them. Click on the **save Option** on the right side and fill in the descriptive values below. We can add these visualizations to the already existing dashboard, or we can create a new one as well.

Steps to take after creating Visualizations:

* Create a visualization and Click on the Save button at the top right corner.
* Add the title and description to the visualization.
* We can add the visualization to any existing Dashboard or a new dashboard.
* Click **Save and add to the library** when it's done.

**Failed Connection Attempts**

We will utilize the knowledge gained above to create a table to display the user and the IP address involved in failed attempts.
